# Kazune

A Proof-of-Concept for what will be an application for showing outro with live chatters

This is coded during [Kaname's stream implementing the same idea using web scraping techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmmlHjIOZrs).
This one uses YouTube APIs for more reliable data gathering of live chats.

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Damillora/Kazune.git
$ yarn install --dev
```

Get a client_secret.json file using the instructions on [YouTube's API Node.js Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/nodejs), then

```
$ electron .
```

Enjoy the Proof-of-Concept!
